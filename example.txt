# as it is in python comments would be '#'
# this example is one of a mac genrator using inbuilt modules


# first import modules
import os #standered libarry stuff

# now importing the inbuilt modules
from mod.system.system_config.mac_gen import mac_maker

def atk(): # this bit is needed as it is what the program imports/calls to run from the file
  os.system("clear")
  mac = str(mac_maker)
  print("[MAC] "+mac)
  
# very basic but a good example(i think)
